No.68/2013 with Cross  Objection (F.A.) No.24/2013.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe main thrust of submission of counsel for review  petitioner (claimant) is that after passing of the judgment of this  court on 30.8.2017, the later judgment of the Apex Court in  National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi & others  reported in AIR 2017 SC 5157 was delivered on 31.10.2017 and  that may come to rescue of the claimant for just compensation  and counsel submits that as far as the judgment of the Apex Court  being     binding   under    Article      141    of   the   Constitution,   the  compensation which          has    been awarded to           him   under the  impugned judgment deserves to be reviewed but to his misfortune                                Page 2 of 2   the Apex Court passed judgment at a later point of time and that  is the reason for which the present review petition has been filed.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe review permissible under Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC has a  very limited scope and can be filed where there is a discovery of  new and important fact or evidence which could not have been  placed despite due diligence or was not within knowledge or on  account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of record.\\n\\n\\n\\tEither of the conditions represented under Order XLVII Rule  1 CPC are not made out and the later judgment of the Apex Court  dt. 31.10.2017 indeed laid down the law binding under Article 141  of the Constitution but that will not open a window for filing a  review application for reappraisal of this view express on the basis  of the law as has been in force at the relevant point of time while  the judgment pronounced by this court.\\n\\n\\tConsequently, in my view, the review petition is without  substance and accordingly dismissed.''']\n",

No.68/2013 with Cross  Objection (F.A.) No.24/2013.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe main thrust of submission of counsel for review  petitioner (claimant) is that after passing of the judgment of this  court on 30.8.2017, the later judgment of the Apex Court in  National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi & others  reported in AIR 2017 SC 5157 was delivered on 31.10.2017 and  that may come to rescue of the claimant for just compensation  and counsel submits that as far as the judgment of the Apex Court  being     binding   under    Article      141    of   the   Constitution,   the  compensation which          has    been awarded to           him   under the  impugned judgment deserves to be reviewed but to his misfortune                                Page 2 of 2   the Apex Court passed judgment at a later point of time and that  is the reason for which the present review petition has been filed.\\n\\n\\n\\tThe review permissible under Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC has a  very limited scope and can be filed where there is a discovery of  new and important fact or evidence which could not have been  placed despite due diligence or was not within knowledge or on  account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of record.\\n\\n\\n\\tEither of the conditions represented under Order XLVII Rule  1 CPC are not made out and the later judgment of the Apex Court  dt. 31.10.2017 indeed laid down the law binding under Article 141  of the Constitution but that will not open a window for filing a  review application for reappraisal of this view express on the basis  of the law as has been in force at the relevant point of time while  the judgment pronounced by this court.\\n\\n\\tConsequently, in my view, the review petition is without  substance and accordingly dismissed.''']\n",
